/* Triangle Project Code.

Triangle analyzes the lengths of the sides of a triangle
  (represented by a, b and c) and returns the type of triangle.

It returns:
  'equilateral'  if all sides are equal
  'isosceles'    if exactly 2 sides are equal
  'scalene'      if no sides are equal

The tests for this method can be found in
  AboutTriangleProject.js
